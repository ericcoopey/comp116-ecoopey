Questions
1.  NMap will only give you a hint if someone is scanning your system, and in and of itself is not that exciting.  Combined with other methods to determine attacker IPs could be useful.

The HTTP Error is not very effective, web servers have lots of 404 errors.

The shellcode would definitely be from an attacker.

2.  I would add failed SSH and FTP attempts, as that is something I see in my logs quite a lot.
